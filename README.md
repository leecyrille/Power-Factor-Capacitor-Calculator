## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser. The calculator will:

1. Default to 3-phase Delta configuration at 600V, 60Hz, 1 kVAR
2. Update results automatically as you change any input
3. Display capacitance values with 4 decimal precision
4. Show appropriate discharge resistance values based on configuration

## Input Parameters

- **System Type**: Single Phase/Per Capacitor or Three Phase Bank
- **Reactive Power (kVAR)**: Total bank reactive power for 3-phase, individual capacitor power for single phase
- **Nameplate Voltage (V)**: Rated voltage from capacitor nameplate (line-to-line for 3-phase)
- **Actual System Voltage (V)**: Measured operating voltage for current calculations
- **Frequency (Hz)**: System frequency (typically 50 or 60 Hz)
- **Connection Type**: Delta (Î”) or Wye (Y) - only applicable for three phase banks

## Formulas Used

### Capacitance Calculations

**Single Phase:**
```
C = Q / (Ï‰ Ã— VÂ²)
```

**Three Phase Delta (per phase):**
```
C = Q / (3 Ã— Ï‰ Ã— V_LLÂ²)
Delta measurement = 1.5 Ã— C (for multimeter testing)
```

**Three Phase Wye (per phase):**
```
C = Q / (3 Ã— Ï‰ Ã— V_phaseÂ²)
where V_phase = V_LL / âˆš3
```

### Discharge Resistance Calculations

**Equivalent Capacitance:**
- Single phase: `C_eq = C`
- Delta (L-L): `C_eq = 1.5 Ã— C_phase`
- Wye (L-L): `C_eq = 0.5 Ã— C_phase`
- Wye (L-N): `C_eq = C_phase`

**Resistance:**
```
R = -t / (C_eq Ã— ln(V_target / V_0))
where t = 300s, V_target = 50V
```

### Current Calculations

**Single Phase:**
```
I = V_actual Ã— Ï‰ Ã— C
```

**Three Phase Delta:**
```
I_capacitor = V_LL Ã— Ï‰ Ã— C_phase
I_line = âˆš3 Ã— I_capacitor
```
- Line current is what you measure on the input line to the bank
- Capacitor current is the current through each individual capacitor element

**Three Phase Wye:**
```
I_line = I_capacitor = V_phase Ã— Ï‰ Ã— C_phase
where V_phase = V_LL / âˆš3
```
- In Wye, line current equals capacitor current
